üîç *Exploring Tic-Tac-Toe in Python* üñ•

I recently created a simple yet engaging Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python. Here's a detailed breakdown of the algorithms, logic, and code implementation:

### Key Features:
1. *Board Display Function:*
   - Utilizes the print_board(board) function to visually represent the 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe board.
   - Displays the board state after every move, ensuring players can see the game progress.

2. *Win Checking Logic:*
   - Implements the check_win(board) function to evaluate winning conditions.
   - Considers all possible winning combinations: rows, columns, and diagonals.
   - Checks for a tie game when no empty spaces are left on the board.

3. *Game Flow Control:*
   - The play_game() function drives the main game loop.
   - Initializes an empty board with nine spaces.
   - Alternates between players "X" and "O" for each move.
   - Ensures valid moves by checking if the chosen position is already occupied.
   - Prompts players for their moves and updates the board accordingly.

4. *Input Handling:*
   - Uses the input() function to capture player moves.
   - Validates inputs to ensure moves are within the valid range and positions are not already taken.

### Core Code Implementation:
python
def print_board(board):
    print(" " + board[0] + " | " + board[1] + " | " + board[2])
    print("---+---+---")
    print(" " + board[3] + " | " + board[4] + " | " + board[5])
    print("---+---+---")
    print(" " + board[6] + " | " + board[7] + " | " + board[8])

def check_win(board):
    win_conditions = [(0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), (0, 3, 6), (1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (0, 4, 8), (2, 4, 6)]
    for condition in win_conditions:
        if board[condition[0]] == board[condition[1]] == board[condition[2]] != " ":
            return board[condition[0]]
    if " " not in board:
        return "Tie"
    return False

def play_game():
    board = [" "] * 9
    current_player = "X"
    while True:
        print_board(board)
        move = input("Player " + current_player + ", enter your move (1-9): ")
        if board[int(move) - 1] != " ":
            print("Invalid move, try again.")
            continue
        board[int(move) - 1] = current_player
        result = check_win(board)
        if result:
            print_board(board)
            if result == "Tie":
                print("It's a tie!")
            else:
                print("Player " + result + " wins!")
            break
        current_player = "O" if current_player == "X" else "X"

play_game()


### Learning Outcomes:
- *Algorithm Design:* Crafted a solution to handle multiple game scenarios and conditions.
- *Input Validation:* Ensured robust input handling to avoid invalid moves.
- *Game Logic Implementation:* Implemented logic to determine game outcomes (win or tie).
- *User Interaction:* Enhanced user experience with clear prompts and game status updates.

Creating this project has been a great exercise in combining logical thinking and Python programming. üéØ Feel free to try it out and share your thoughts! üåü
